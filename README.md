### What I Want 
* a 2048 game using flower characters instead of numbers 
* when a flower is swiped to another flower it creates the next level up
* when you get to the daisy you win! 

### What I Need

* the ability to use a swiping motion to say where i want the board to move 
    * ie. swipe right, all pieces swipe right
* matching pieces combine to create the next level up
* The score tells you what your highest flower is 
* To Win says which flower you need to win 
* restart button resets the board 

### Questions I Have 

* ~~Should I change the to win to best score?~~
    * won't be doing this - i'd have to add characters for getting higher than 2048
        * so game will end when player reaches 2048
* ~~Can the starting piece start somewhere random?~~
    * **with a matrix** *(thanks will!)*

        0 1 2 3
* Am I too overzealous for wanting to draw the flower characters 

### How to get Started 

* make basic html outline to get game info 
* start in JS to get piece to show up in random square 
* slide function
